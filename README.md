# areocolor
Examples and scripts for color processing and calibrating Mars images from PDS and web. Currently not much is added yet, more to come soon...

This is based on experience from the actual production code I created in 2021 for https://areo.info/mars20 processing daily Perseverance Rover and Ingenuity images.

For concepts of Mars images processing and calibrated images refer to the following PDFs: https://researchgate.net/profile/Holger-Isenberg
